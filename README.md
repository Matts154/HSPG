"Hand Swapping Password Generator". A really small bit of code that produces a random password while keeping it easy to type.

It prompts the user for a password length and generates a password by changing which side of the keyboard a character is chosen from. The idea behind this is to have a password that is immune to dictionary attacks but is easy to type.
