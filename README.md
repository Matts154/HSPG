"Hand Swapping Password Generator". A really small bit of code that produces a random password while keeping it easy to type.

It prompts the user for a password length and generates a password by changing which side of the keyboard a character is chosen from. The idea behind this is to have a password that is immune to dictionary attacks but is easy to type.


Sample Output:
----
<ul>
  <li>30xp!ht7</li>
  <li>vhx0vy#k</li>
  <li>c8fnfhb74p</li>
  <li>vu@1@k!lx[e[xh#</li>
</ul>
